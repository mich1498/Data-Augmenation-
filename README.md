# Data-Augmenation-
Data augmentation is a crucial task for training deep neural networks. I have written a code which performs some of the most common data augmentation tasks such as scaling , cropping, color jittering and rotation. This is a preprocessing step that can be applied to images when tranining an image classification model.
